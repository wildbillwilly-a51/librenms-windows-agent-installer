# Work Log

## 2026-07-16

- Reworked the FactoryTalk app-page presentation without changing collection,
  alerts, or RRD schemas. The operational view now leads with status, next
  action, six key metrics, actionable conditions, and the top five runtime
  processes; complete inventory/counter rows and secondary graphs remain in
  nested disclosures. Added healthy, stopped-service/port, missing-data, and
  unavailable-native-snapshot fixture coverage, and corrected the app-page
  fixture runner's stale source filename and duplicated legacy application-name
  expectations.
- Rebuilt the in-place 0.6.13 overlay package. Overlay SHA256:
  `44268bddfdaa44f8702e0fed77aca2722c97b703073ccd93134a32aa69374b36`.
  The MSI was intentionally unchanged at SHA256
  `f80710d424b963da856396eb1e6643a98563e657b666b08ab88e7f571655bda6`.
  JSON parsing, Git whitespace checks, 53 portable agent tests, complete source
  and packaged PHP lint, all eight parser fixtures, all eight app-page fixtures,
  package build, tar listing, manifest/payload inspection, checksum
  verification, and headless healthy-desktop/warning-mobile rendering passed.
  The public-readiness sanitizer passed with 162 included and 29 excluded
  files; its generic history policy still rejects this repository's
  intentionally tracked release artifacts and work log. No LibreNMS deployment
  was performed.
- Removed both agent PowerShell custom actions and their packaged scripts from
  0.6.13. The MSI now installs a permanent never-overwrite `agent.json`, starts
  the automatic service through the standard `ServiceControl` table, and uses
  WiX Firewall extension tables for program-scoped domain/private TCP 6556
  rules. Listener binding is checked synchronously during service startup.
- Rebuilt release 0.6.13 in place. Overlay SHA256:
  `5ce97913b75bc579c6f9f70b0e4f98650d55381b80d4b3e8e0279a68a16a1b65`.
  MSI SHA256:
  `f80710d424b963da856396eb1e6643a98563e657b666b08ab88e7f571655bda6`.
  All portable tests, .NET Framework/WiX builds, native MSI table assertions,
  decompiled payload/config inspection, extracted collector execution, and a
  real TCP listener response passed. PHP remained unavailable, so unchanged
  overlay PHP lint was skipped. No endpoint deployment was performed.
- Diagnosed the follow-up 0.6.13 failure as Windows native command-line parsing:
  quoted MSI directory values ended in a backslash, which consumed the closing
  quote and corrupted later PowerShell arguments. Private endpoint evidence
  remains outside this repository.
- Corrected 0.6.13 in place by deriving the install directory from the installed
  script and the data directory from the MSI registry value, with a safe common
  application-data fallback. Added MSI build assertions that reject explicit
  directory arguments and oversized custom-action commands.
- Rebuilt release 0.6.13 in place. Overlay SHA256:
  `384c77cfb3825dcf45d2528c2d61ad9e4454aa0db77f5b2468d9ed2c01cf631d`.
  MSI SHA256:
  `a866f5feb96095a28b3eacd5e47c5f0b9e5a50d67a258fab2db7419e89964784`.
  The Windows PowerShell 5.1 space-containing-path test, all portable .NET
  tests, .NET Framework/WiX builds, MSI metadata and command assertions, and
  checksum generation passed. PHP remained unavailable, so overlay PHP lint
  was skipped; overlay source behavior is unchanged.
- Diagnosed a generic 0.6.13 major-upgrade failure from private non-production
  evidence. Windows Installer removed the prior package, then the deferred
  configuration action failed while launching the installed agent executable;
  the external deployment wrapper incorrectly reported success despite the MSI
  recording error 1603. Private host evidence remains outside this repository.
- Repaired 0.6.13 in place. The MSI no longer launches the agent executable as
  a PowerShell child merely to revalidate an already parsed configuration;
  instead it verifies the installed file and requires the service to reach
  `Running`. Same-version upgrades are allowed, and `RemoveExistingProducts`
  now runs after `InstallInitialize` so rollback can restore the prior package.
- Preserved older configurations now receive every complete-set FactoryTalk
  property when the MSI feature is enabled, including runtime metrics, native
  interval/timeout defaults, and localhost native-counter mode.
- Rebuilt release 0.6.13 in place. Overlay SHA256:
  `761953ce7db1a376898a55b3184f2356c397d52c874dbbccc7d33bd4b50c162e`.
  MSI SHA256:
  `e5a861ccb0d86a635a6c589306ea1298b5eb62befc4e408ed0803ceff6c2dd87`.
  Validation passed for the exact preserved pilot configuration under Windows
  PowerShell 5.1, all portable .NET tests, warning-free .NET Framework/WiX
  builds, same-version/rollback MSI table assertions, package contents, and
  checksums. PHP remained unavailable; overlay source behavior is unchanged.
- Added the `ENABLE_FACTORYTALK_NATIVE_COUNTERS` MSI property, defaulting to
  enabled. The installer applies `nativeCountersMode=local` to both fresh and
  preserved configurations; setting the property to `0` provides a direct
  rollback without disabling Windows-native FactoryTalk runtime metrics.
- Initially built release 0.6.13 and refreshed the MSI, overlay, current installer
  defaults, documentation, and checksum manifest. Overlay SHA256:
  `e948079cd045fc08bd3d6b6bdef6434e93832bc1393218ca4d6150ca9e7768ab`.
  MSI SHA256:
  `f762c5c137261a8b6d47a4bb5fc167379e8623f51be3514938ecd2c3e302c66e`.
- Validation passed for all portable .NET tests, the .NET Framework service and
  WiX builds, MSI metadata, PowerShell/Bash parsing, package contents, and
  checksums. A non-privileged temporary install-layout test also confirmed the
  enabled and disabled property paths update a preserved configuration and pass
  agent validation. PHP was unavailable locally, so overlay PHP lint was
  skipped; the 0.6.13 overlay source is unchanged from the previously linted
  0.6.12 release.
- Implemented FactoryTalk Windows-native runtime metrics and a safe opt-in
  FactoryTalk Diagnostics Counter Monitor snapshot path. The snapshot runner is
  localhost-only, verifies Rockwell Authenticode trust, skips concurrent/manual
  instances, bounds runtime and XML size, parses an explicit counter allowlist,
  caches sanitized last-good results, and removes temporary XML.
- Extended the overlay with additive FactoryTalk runtime/native protocol
  parsing, five new RRD families, conditional graphs, and runtime/native detail
  views. The established FactoryTalk health RRD and alert behavior are
  unchanged.
- Added portable parser security/allowlist tests and a fabricated overlay
  fixture. .NET tests and the .NET Framework service build passed using the
  installed SDK with supported runtime roll-forward; PHP fixture/lint execution
  was unavailable on this workstation and remains a release-validation item.
- Authenticode interop was validated against a trusted embedded-signature
  control, and the Rockwell signer allowlist correctly rejected the trusted
  non-Rockwell control.
- Built release 0.6.12. Overlay SHA256:
  `1e65f17d76750e0690afef82a806d33670ae60423648dec27209c2a11f899b8d`.
  MSI SHA256:
  `925456f75a8d56c0eeb73af3fc610de4f4379f50a80cb3443e0933c8d8f40582`.
- Added committed sanitized-backup policy that excludes versioned release
  binaries from the source fallback. Release binaries remain checksum-verified
  public distribution artifacts in the canonical repository; the isolated
  backup preserves the audited source snapshot.

## 2026-07-15

- Audited the canonical and legacy repositories before consolidation. All 55
  agent source files matched after the intentional generic namespace, service,
  and protocol renames; the 50 C# test names also matched, and the newer legacy
  commits changed only private project-export context.
- Quarantined the legacy local repository as
  `librenms-windows-agent-legacy`, preserving its modified README, untracked
  export, Git history, and ignored internal artifacts.
- Updated the canonical project name, public installer repository defaults,
  and README URLs from `librenms-windows-agent-installer` to
  `librenms-windows-agent`.
- Renamed the private GitHub repository to `librenms-windows-agent-legacy`,
  renamed the public canonical repository to `librenms-windows-agent`, updated
  both local remotes, and published the canonical commits. The final local
  canonical directory rename is pending because the active Codex workspace
  holds the directory open.
- Validation: installer PowerShell parsing, Bash syntax, `git diff --check`,
  active old-name reference scanning, and release checksum verification passed.
  The isolated backup scanner reported only the intentionally tracked MSI and
  overlay release binaries and no text, credential, or infrastructure finding.

## 2026-07-14

- Migrated the current universal agent core, Windows service collectors,
  portable tests, MSI source, generic sample configuration, LibreNMS overlay
  source, parser/app fixtures, architecture notes, and collector roadmap into
  this repository.
- Added native `build-msi.ps1`, `build-overlay-package.ps1`, and
  `build-release.ps1` workflows; retired the sibling-repository promotion
  script and updated the project boundary, current-state handoff, README,
  release runbook, and Codex guide.
- Preserved the published 0.6.11 artifacts and checksums. Source and staging
  scans found no private hostnames, IPs, usernames, device IDs, or legacy
  branding. C# tests and MSI rebuilding were skipped because no .NET SDK is
  installed; remaining validation is recorded below.
- Validation: native overlay packaging passed. The generated package differs
  from published 0.6.11 only in explicit ordinal manifest ordering and
  scanner-friendly construction of the environment-supplied web login form
  key. PowerShell parsing, JSON/XML structure, project-reference checks,
  portable-Git Bash syntax checks, published artifact checksum verification,
  and imported-source privacy scans passed. PHP lint/fixtures and Python syntax
  compilation were skipped because PHP and Python are unavailable.
- Publication: the local transition commit was created, but the public push is
  pending because non-interactive Git credentials are unavailable in the
  current shell.
- Synchronized the installed new-project setup workflow in the public installer
  repository while preserving project-specific release, validation, and
  public-safety rules.
- Added the versioned workflow marker, managed ignore and line-ending policy,
  autonomous/prototype/portable-resume guidance, and the isolated sanitized
  GitHub backup helper.
- Validation: managed setup check, PowerShell helper parse, and Git diff checks
  passed. The isolated-backup scan inspected committed `HEAD` and blocked only
  on the intentionally published MSI and overlay archives under the
  `unreviewed-binary` rule; no blanket allowances were added. The GitHub CLI is
  also not installed, so isolated GitHub backup remains pending. The existing
  public distribution push is handled by this repository's normal
  verified-snapshot workflow.

## 2026-07-10

- Added the missing primary runbook step to enable the `Windows Agent` application on each LibreNMS device under the device `Applications` tab after installing the Windows agent.
- Clarified that per-device module overrides are separate from the per-device `Windows Agent` application enablement.
- Validation: documentation-only update; `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-07-07

- Corrected the public README after the 0.6.8 promotion so the direct MSI link, specific overlay version example, `msiexec` install commands, and silent uninstall command point at `librenms-windows-agent-0.6.8.msi`.
- Validation: current README/reference scan and `git diff --check` passed; raw URL checks for the 0.6.8 MSI and overlay were already verified during promotion.

## 2026-07-06

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.6 and Windows MSI from development commit b1b869c with checksums 51850d31f413840ecd455bc6e0aff214a3bc1f911bada8c54ac4b054c947ac89 and 2cab3b4c1609cf1acd9c0f82d042227b9afa7030af096bf8eb1709e1cb15ddce. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, raw URL verification, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.
- Corrected the public README after the 0.6.6 promotion so direct MSI examples point at `librenms-windows-agent-0.6.6.msi` and diagnostics expect `collectors_run=22`.
- Validation: README stale-reference scan and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-07-05

- Added a public README performance and scaling section with observed Windows-agent poller worker-time cost, capacity math for 100-150 Windows devices, and rollout checks using LibreNMS Poller Cluster Health.
- Validation: documentation diff review and `git diff --check` passed for README, work log, and changelog.

## 2026-07-04

- Reworked the public README into a step-by-step primary runbook: confirm SNMP-backed LibreNMS device discovery, enable `Applications` and `Unix Agent` globally, install the overlay on every LibreNMS node/poller, install or update the Windows agent, and poll/verify. Optional per-device overrides, overlay options, MSI properties, rollback, collector expectations, and diagnostics are now in an addendum.
- Fixed stale `install.sh --help` version wording so it no longer names an old default release.
- Validation: README/current-version scan, shell syntax check, PowerShell installer parse, and `git diff --check` passed.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.5 and Windows MSI from development commit 51180e3 with checksums 2b70bc3b01d3f481930b07246e2bdea46cc457c83c3345ccccd57df71d267575 and 15f5c0f83a38cd2a0fb4f9f1f952cbb35ee38b53833d37a0831dd5fb57172e60. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.4 and Windows MSI from development commit c9e48c3 with checksums 92b04928d69ab3bec8f5f89e5c4cfbe0fca11e6453456dde9e80ec7262c1ac67 and 1a515ccaa735c0eede0eeca6dff64891b498df90fdcffdb6d95f87a08f7bfbfb. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Updated current public instructions and installer docs to reference the promoted 0.6.3 MSI and overlay artifacts.
- Validation: `bash -n`, PowerShell parse, 0.6.3 tar listing, SHA256 checks, current-reference scan, `git diff --check`, and raw URL checks passed.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.3 and Windows MSI from development commit 6d595f2 with checksums d78bb063ecc6b18900dfb37f42c62074b1d96cd65389e505a5df34d0ce36930a and 05bbf6851568da4bc72096bd4c65c719093c1652a20cff3bf9095aa869124d33.

- Updated current public instructions and installer docs to reference the promoted x64 0.6.2 MSI and overlay artifacts.
- Validation: `bash -n`, PowerShell parse, 0.6.2 tar listing, SHA256 checks, current-reference scan, `git diff --check`, and raw URL checks passed.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.2 and Windows MSI from development commit db0126b with checksums b5418bb1863316bedde423cb3a0c4e43fecf5e28ea3b71eb35cf3ec6c521d212 and 60858d312631ecc4206d8a02dc0ce986eff18d5022238c4d11abc7727f134b47. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Hardened `install-agent.ps1` so it removes prior LibreNMS Windows Agent MSI packages before install, accepts MSI reboot-required success, verifies the installed service executable exists, verifies the expected file version, verifies config creation, and prints the actual service executable path.
- Updated the promotion workflow so `install-agent.ps1` receives the promoted version automatically along with `install.sh`.
- Validation: PowerShell parse for `install-agent.ps1` and `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` passed; `git diff --check` passed.

- Updated current public instructions and installer defaults to reference the promoted 0.6.1 MSI and overlay artifacts instead of stale 0.6.0 examples.
- Validation: `bash -n`, PowerShell parse, 0.6.1 tar listing, SHA256 checks, stale current-reference scan, and `git diff --check` passed.

Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Added README prerequisites for LibreNMS `unix-agent` and `applications`
  poller modules, including global UI, per-device UI, global CLI, per-device
  CLI enablement, and per-device override removal.
- Validation: reviewed upstream LibreNMS module override handling and checked
  the README diff; no installer artifacts changed.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.0 and Windows MSI from development commit bc23c4b with checksums f83a6a59656681582d4f980ff8d0a4c41fd26f26441c633881701656980fceb2 and 60a0a2fcce8d130cf34e0a6cabdd544e7a69a7156ddd2b17751946a25bfe3d6c.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.0 from development commit eedf0df with checksum b45e5be3314964dd62909bc085557ba13b4b4386ffca3318bcc5d65eb96a5234. Validation: generated package tar listing, checksum update, and legacy-branding scan passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Created the public generic LibreNMS Windows Agent installer repository with a
  one-command server-side overlay installer and checksum-pinned release payload.
- Added local-first project workflow files so this local Git repo is the
  primary project record and GitHub remains the sanitized public distribution
  mirror.
- Added full project documentation for opening this folder as its own Codex
  project, including current state, read order, release runbook, and upstream
  sync model.
- Added `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` as the official interim
  promotion path from the private development overlay package to the public
  generic installer package.
- Updated the installer workflow so promotion into this repo is the review
  boundary and successful local installer commits automatically push to GitHub.
- Validation: installer syntax, tarball listing, checksum generation, raw
  GitHub URL checks, and legacy-branding scan were run during initial
  publication. PHP lint was skipped because PHP is not installed locally.

- Corrected the public README and current project docs after the 0.6.9 promotion so direct MSI links, specific overlay version examples, `msiexec` install commands, and silent uninstall commands point at `librenms-windows-agent-0.6.9.msi`.
- Hardened `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` so future promotions update README/current-version docs and fail before commit if current public docs still contain stale promoted-version references.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `docs/release-runbook.md`, and `docs/codex-project-guide.md` to make README current-link/script/artifact updates an explicit release requirement.
- Validation: README/current-version scan, promotion-script PowerShell parse, raw URL checks for the 0.6.9 MSI and overlay, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Promoted overlay package 0.6.9 and Windows MSI from development commit b212262 with checksums 702f6ead433c2d7e80864f5d264ec0c4e0af8f81913388a6639201ace5189c29 and 3b56e59c09668e39e61d600eff629e0accd2b75c9b7810d8354f26d244952492. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.
