# Work Log

## 2026-07-07

- Corrected the public README after the 0.6.8 promotion so the direct MSI link, specific overlay version example, `msiexec` install commands, and silent uninstall command point at `librenms-windows-agent-0.6.8.msi`.
- Validation: current README/reference scan and `git diff --check` passed; raw URL checks for the 0.6.8 MSI and overlay were already verified during promotion.

## 2026-07-06

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.6 and Windows MSI from development commit b1b869c with checksums 51850d31f413840ecd455bc6e0aff214a3bc1f911bada8c54ac4b054c947ac89 and 2cab3b4c1609cf1acd9c0f82d042227b9afa7030af096bf8eb1709e1cb15ddce. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, raw URL verification, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.
- Corrected the public README after the 0.6.6 promotion so direct MSI examples point at `librenms-windows-agent-0.6.6.msi` and diagnostics expect `collectors_run=22`.
- Validation: README stale-reference scan and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-07-05

- Added a public README performance and scaling section with observed Windows-agent poller worker-time cost, capacity math for 100-150 Windows devices, and rollout checks using LibreNMS Poller Cluster Health.
- Validation: documentation diff review and `git diff --check` passed for README, work log, and changelog.

## 2026-07-04

- Reworked the public README into a step-by-step primary runbook: confirm SNMP-backed LibreNMS device discovery, enable `Applications` and `Unix Agent` globally, install the overlay on every LibreNMS node/poller, install or update the Windows agent, and poll/verify. Optional per-device overrides, overlay options, MSI properties, rollback, collector expectations, and diagnostics are now in an addendum.
- Fixed stale `install.sh --help` version wording so it no longer names an old default release.
- Validation: README/current-version scan, shell syntax check, PowerShell installer parse, and `git diff --check` passed.

- Promoted overlay package 0.6.5 and Windows MSI from development commit 51180e3 with checksums 2b70bc3b01d3f481930b07246e2bdea46cc457c83c3345ccccd57df71d267575 and 15f5c0f83a38cd2a0fb4f9f1f952cbb35ee38b53833d37a0831dd5fb57172e60. Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Updated current public instructions and installer docs to reference the promoted 0.6.3 MSI and overlay artifacts.
- Validation: `bash -n`, PowerShell parse, 0.6.3 tar listing, SHA256 checks, current-reference scan, `git diff --check`, and raw URL checks passed.

Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Hardened `install-agent.ps1` so it removes prior LibreNMS Windows Agent MSI packages before install, accepts MSI reboot-required success, verifies the installed service executable exists, verifies the expected file version, verifies config creation, and prints the actual service executable path.
- Updated the promotion workflow so `install-agent.ps1` receives the promoted version automatically along with `install.sh`.
- Validation: PowerShell parse for `install-agent.ps1` and `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` passed; `git diff --check` passed.

- Updated current public instructions and installer defaults to reference the promoted 0.6.1 MSI and overlay artifacts instead of stale 0.6.0 examples.

Validation: generated package tar listing, MSI build, checksum update, public agent --once check, and legacy-branding scans passed; PHP lint depends on local PHP availability.

- Added README prerequisites for LibreNMS `unix-agent` and `applications`
  poller modules, including global UI, per-device UI, global CLI, per-device
  CLI enablement, and per-device override removal.
- Validation: reviewed upstream LibreNMS module override handling and checked
  the README diff; no installer artifacts changed.

- Created the public generic LibreNMS Windows Agent installer repository with a
  one-command server-side overlay installer and checksum-pinned release payload.
- Added local-first project workflow files so this local Git repo is the
  primary project record and GitHub remains the sanitized public distribution
  mirror.
- Added full project documentation for opening this folder as its own Codex
  project, including current state, read order, release runbook, and upstream
  sync model.
- Added `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` as the official interim
  promotion path from the private development overlay package to the public
  generic installer package.
- Updated the installer workflow so promotion into this repo is the review
  boundary and successful local installer commits automatically push to GitHub.
- Validation: installer syntax, tarball listing, checksum generation, raw
  GitHub URL checks, and legacy-branding scan were run during initial
  publication. PHP lint was skipped because PHP is not installed locally.
