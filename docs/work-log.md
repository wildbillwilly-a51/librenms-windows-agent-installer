- Created the public generic LibreNMS Windows Agent installer repository with a
  one-command server-side overlay installer and checksum-pinned release payload.
- Added local-first project workflow files so this local Git repo is the
  primary project record and GitHub remains the sanitized public distribution
  mirror.
- Added full project documentation for opening this folder as its own Codex
  project, including current state, read order, release runbook, and upstream
  sync model.
- Added `scripts/promote-from-dev-overlay.ps1` as the official interim
  promotion path from the private development overlay package to the public
  generic installer package.
- Updated the installer workflow so promotion into this repo is the review
  boundary and successful local installer commits automatically push to GitHub.
- Validation: installer syntax, tarball listing, checksum generation, raw
  GitHub URL checks, and legacy-branding scan were run during initial
  publication. PHP lint was skipped because PHP is not installed locally.
